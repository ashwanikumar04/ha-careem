# Code Repository for Careem Hackathon

# Problem Statement

One of the goals we strive towards at Careem is creating a perfect booking experience for our Customers- extremely reliable ETAS, accurate locations, best Captains and so on. Build a ride dispatching platform that collects location updates from ‘drivers on the move’ to later be used as data to dispatch the best driver to a customer that wants to book a ride. It is up to you to creatively decide the features, capability and complexity of the platform (Eg: Moving cars on the map, multiple bookings per driver etc.)

# Approach 

- Distributed System for serving requests
